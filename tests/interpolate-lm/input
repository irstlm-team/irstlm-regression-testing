<s> hon. sharon carstairs : </s>
<s> the filmmaker is andrée cazabon . </s>

<s> at the age of 14 , she took to the streets of ottawa , montreal and toronto . </s>
<s> through the efforts of operation go home and through the help and assistance of rideauwood addiction and family services , andrée left the streets , received treatment for her addiction to drugs , returned to school and became a film producer . </s>

<s> today , honourable senators will receive in their offices a letter from the honourable ethel blondin @-@ andrew explaining how to gain access to this film through the house of commons broadcasting branch . </s>
<s> honourable senators , in the question and answer session following the presentation , i asked andrée why she had taken to the streets . </s>
<s> she said it was because of a sexual assault that took place while she had been on a visit to a farm . </s>
